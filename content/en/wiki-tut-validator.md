This article will help you run a validator node from scratch and become a validator.

<hr />

## Run your validator node

You can choose either run node with execute file download before or in docker way. No matter which way you start, please make sure 
to include `--unsafe-rpc-external --rpc-methods=Unsafe` in command line to prepare for the generation of `session keys`.

- Run validator node with existed node binary
  
  ```sh
  ./darwinia \
      --base-path <YourDataDir> \
      --name <YourNodeName> \
      --validator \
      --unsafe-rpc-external \
      --rpc-methods=Unsafe
	```  

- Using docker
  
  ```bash
  docker run -d -v <YourDataDir>:/data -p 30333:30333 darwinianetwork/darwinia:v0.7.0 \
	  --base-path /data \
  	  --name <YourNodeName> \
      --validator \
  	  --unsafe-rpc-external \
  	  --rpc-methods=Unsafe
    ```

<hr />

## Generate your session key

Run the command on the shell where your validator node is running:

```sh
$ curl http://127.0.0.1:9933 -H "Content-Type:application/json;charset=utf-8" -d \
'{
  "jsonrpc":"2.0",
  "id":1,
  "method":"author_rotateKeys",
  "params": []
}'
```

If there is no problem, a result similar to the following will be returned:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc":"2.0", "result":"0xba99ecfb4a87357a44ee2765cf617a6d81adf8f43e522db52e348d2f9d45ccde12d53d562e14bb18522fbc3032b786f44b2b92240f4756386d4baec68bbfb882bbabcce1440c84d7f5b67c8ecb956345100d5dbd07adfeba3d9482f95d9dec6c68d085323e61590f850c38244dd2c2bc4055548d9edfd0471f47da7667c17fe8",
  "id":1}
```

The result is what you need when setting the session key.

## Start staking

1. Enter [Darwinia Wallet](https://apps.darwinia.network) and click the [Staking] column on the left , Click [Start staking].
   
   ![tut-validator-a](assets/tut-validator-a.png)


2. Fill in the staking parameters
   
   ![tut-validator-b](assets/tut-validator-b.png)
   
  - ` Stash account` Account for stashing tokens. Tokens participating in staking will come from this account. The operations of this account are mostly related to changes in stash.
  - `Controller account`  The controller is the account that will be used to control any nominating or validating actions. Should not match another stash or controller.
     
	 > The `Stash account` and ` Controller account` can be set to the same account. If you hold more tokens or have higher security requirements, it is recommended to set up different accounts here.

  - `Value bonded` The total amount of the stash balance that will be at stake in any forthcoming rounds (should be less than the total amount available).  This part of the tokens will be temporarily bonded. bonding takes 14 days to unbond; you can choose to bond RING or KTON.
  - `Payment destination` The destination account for any payment as either a nominator or validator.
  - `Bond period` Optional; bond RING promise for 1-36 months to get additional KTON rewards. (Promise to lock to accept user terms)

     > If you unlock RING in advance within the lock limit, you will be charged a penalty of 3 times the KTON reward (In the absence of sufficient KTON, the RING can not be used for payment of fines).

3. After filling in the staking parameters, please click [bond] and [submit]

## Set session key

1. Click [Set session key] on this page, completing the generated session key and submit. 
    
	> The session key must be filled with real data, otherwise it will result in missing blocks and be slashed.
	
	![tut-validator-1](assets/tut-validator-1.png)

2. After confirming, click [sign and submit] 
   
   > The identities of the validator and the nominator are mutually exclusive and cannot coexist. If you are running a validator, you need to cancel the validator before proceeding with the nomination.
   
   ![tut-validator-2](assets/tut-validator-2.png)

3. Click [validate] and set the validator parameters
   
   ![tut-validator-3](assets/tut-validator-3.png)
   
   - `Reward commission percentage` Set the proportion of the node's priority distribution of income, the range is 0-100. (Example: If a 5% reward commission is set, this node will first receive 5% of the node's revenue, and the remaining 95% of the node's revenue will be distributed in proportion to the amount of mortgages validated by the validator and nominator; Validator's income = node reward commission + mortgage reward share)
  
4. After confirming, click [sign and submit]
   
   ![tut-validator-4](assets/tut-validator-4.png)

5. Go to [staking scan] to view information about validators
   
   ![tut-validator-5](assets/tut-validator-5.png)
   
     > The operation of validate will take effect after the first epoch of the next era (about 24 hours). Prior to this, the validator will be in the [waiting] list.
	
	**(Optional) Rerun your validator node**
	
	For security, you need to remove the rpc unsafe parameters and re-run your node:

   ```bash
   docker run -d -v <YourDataDir>:/data -p 30333:30333 darwinianetwork/darwinia:v0.7.0 \
     --base-path /data \
     --name <YourNodeName> \
   	 --validator
   ```

## Other Staking operations

There are other operations in staking for the following purposes:

![](assets/wiki-tut-validator-6-en.png)

- `Stop nomination` Cancels all nominees.

- `Bond` & `Bond more` Adds bonded tokens for staking to obtain more power.

- `Unbond` Unbond tokens for staking, and at the same time the power will be reduced proportionally.

  > The 14-day bond period is required to unbond. Tokens that are in the bond period cannot be operated. Please be careful.

- `Reward history` Go to Subscan explorer to view historical reward records.

- `Claim reward` Manually claim the reward, and the reward will be distributed in units of era.

  > Please note: 56 era (about 56 days) will be saved, and you will not be able to claim it if it expires.

- `Claim Reward`Â Manually claim the reward, and the reward will be distributed in units of era.
  
- `Bond more funds` Adds bonded tokens for staking to obtain more power.
  
- `Unbond funds` Unbond tokens for staking, and at the same time the power will be reduced proportionally. 
  
- `Lock Extra` Add lock limit for bonded tokens to obtain KTON rewards.
  
- `Rebond funds` Rebond the unbonding funds to earn power.

- `Change controller account` Change the account  that will be used to control any nominating or validating actions. Should not match another stash or controller.
  
- `Change reward destination` Change the destination account for any payment as either a nominator or validator.
