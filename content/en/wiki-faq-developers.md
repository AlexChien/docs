### How can I contribute?

Two programs have been set up for developers, the Grant Program and Bounty program.

* **Grant Program**
  
  Darwinia Grant will focus on funding the development of the Darwinia ecosystem, such as development of the Darwinia Network, development and maintenance of the Darwinia Appchain, and related theoretical research. Please check out the [details](https://github.com/darwinia-network/collaboration/blob/master/grant/README.md) here. 


* **Bounty Program**
  
  We will rate the issues in Darwinia and invite community developers to help with the fix. Community developers can get rewards after fixing the problem and being reviewed. The rewards for fixing different levels of issue will be different. Please Please click [here](https://github.com/darwinia-network/collaboration/blob/master/bounty/README.md) to check more details. 

You can also join the [dev group](https://t.me/DarwiniaDev) for more latest details.
