Darwinia Network is a blockchain network based on Substrate[1] technology. 

Darwinia Network is part of the Polkadot ecosystem, and at the same time differentiated from Polkadot, Darwinia Network focuses on cross-chain token. 

Blockchain Dapps can easily perform cross-chain token transactions and transfer through the Darwinia Network. For example, Cryptokitties can transform its NFT (Kitties) on the Ethereum into NFT on EOS through the Darwinia chain; players on the Ethereum and players on the EOS can play Evolution Land game simultaneously through the Darwinia Network. 

At the same time, thanks to the Polkadot ecosystem, Darwinia Network can link to a wider range of games and players.
