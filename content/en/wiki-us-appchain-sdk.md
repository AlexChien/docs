In order to facilitate application developers to develop blockchain networks that meet application-level requirements, without having to deeply understand blockchain technology, the Darwinia Network team developed a framework to utilize blockchains based on Substrate and Darwinia Web Application Tools. This framework is called Appchain SDK.

Its design goal is to meet the needs of the application level, the business level, rather than the platform requirements of the public chain, so Darwinia Appchain will focus on the flexibility of the framework, the diversity of components; and the consensus algorithm, the speed of the block, and the governance model will be very different from the public chain.

The Appchain SDK  is a set of blockchain development kits that can be tailored to the needs of application developers for different blockchain networks. It can even create a blockchain with one-click, provide random number services and DKMS distributed key management services. The appchains developed based on this SDK will also use Substrate kernel, which is designed to be a sub-chain that connects to the Darwinia Network bridge chain.
