## Airdrop
**Darwinia will Airdrop the RING & DOT holders.**

A portion of the initial supply of the Crabâ€˜s CRING will be distributed to the holders of RING & DOT, they will get CRING (Airdrop) for free.

Darwinia took a snapshot of RING & DOT holders on March 20, 2020 (GMT +8:00). RING & DOT holders can check / receive CRING after Crab launched.

- DOT airdrop ratio: 1 DOT = 50 CRING
- RING airdrop ratio: 1 RING = 1 CRING

> The snapshot contains the RING of ERC-20 and TRC-20, including the deposit certificate part in Gringotts. KTON is not in the scope of this snapshot.
