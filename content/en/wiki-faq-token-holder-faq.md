### What is the Power?

Users participate in staking, and the rights and interests obtained by bond RING or KTON are called Power.

<hr />

### How to get Power and how to calculate the amount of Power?

Bond RING or KTON can get Power, where the bonded RING total amount and KTON total amount respectively correspond to 1/2 of Power total amount.

* Total Power = 1 (Decimals: 10^9)
* Power obtained by bonded RING = number of bonded RING / current total number of bonded RING * (total power / 2)
* Power obtained by bonded KTON = number of bonded KTON / current total number of bonded KTON * (total number of Power / 2)

<hr />

### What is the Power share?

Power share is the percentage of Power held in Power total.Power share can reflect the influence on the entire network. The larger the Power share.The greater the Power share, the greater the influence of the decision made on the entire network.

* Power share = Power held / Total Power * 100%

<hr />

### Why does my power share increased & reduced?

The change of Power share depends on two factors:

* Changes in the number of self bonded assets
* Changes in the number of current network total bonded assets
  

Therefore, if you find that the “Power share” has changed without any operation or no change in the self bonded assets, it is normal and may be caused by the change in the current total number of bonded assets on the network.

<hr />

### Why can I not find RING/KTON within Metamask?

You need to add RING/KTON to Metamask as a custom token. Please visit the Website homepage to see how to do it.

<hr />

### What's the difference between Ring and KTON?

RING = normal staking and currency for blockchain fees

KTON = professional staking for node operators

<hr />

### What is the utility of the RING token?

RING is the native token of the Darwinia Network. It is used to pay for fees in a similar manner to how ETH is used on the Ethereum network and can also be used for staking.

<hr />

### What is the total supply of RING tokens?

Total supply of RING will be 2 billion upon launch of mainnet and supply grows at approximately 5% annually. 100% of newly minted RING goes to staking reward pools to incentive validators and nominators who take care of the security of the network.

<hr />

### What is the utility of the KTON token?

KTON is the commitment token of the Darwinia Network and for the purpose of staking and/or operating a validator it is the preferred choice vs. RING alone.

When users voluntarily lock their RING for some period between 1 month and 36 months they receive KTON as a reward.  When used for staking, rewards are split equally between the RING and KTON staking pools.  For example, if you lock 10K RING for a year, you will get 1 KTON immediately and 10K RING back in a year’s time. 

<hr />

### What is the total supply of KTON tokens?

KTON token supply was initially zero and can only be minted when users lock their RING in the process of staking. It also has some deflationary mechanisms built-in.

<hr />

### How long do I need to wait for unstaking/withdrawing my tokens?

It takes 14 days to unbond tokens from staking.

<hr />

### How much RING is locked in staking pools?

Please click [here](https://etherscan.io/token/0x9469d013805bffb7d3debe5e7839237e535ec483?a=0x649fdf6ee483a96e020b889571e93700fbd82d88) to check out the current figures on Subscan.io.

<hr />

### What was the IEO or ICO? 

Due to laws and regulations, no ICO or IEO has been conducted.  We performed several rounds of community airdrop in the past to encourage users to participate in our test network as well as in Evolution Land, a blockchain game within Darwinia Ecosystem.

<hr />

### Will KTON be listed anywhere else?

KTON is mainly traded via decentralized exchanges such as Uniswap.  It can be also found on hoo.com, mxc.com, poloniex.com, etc. and more. Check out coinmarketcap.com regularly to find all the latest exchanges who support KTON and RING trading pairs.

<hr />

### Is the Darwinia network only used for blockchain games?

Darwinia Network was originally designed to be the low-level cross-chain solution for Evolution Land, but evolved into an independent decentralized cross-chain infrastructure which now benefits the whole crypto industry.  Dapps from gaming, NFT to Defi, Stablecoin can all leverage Darwinia Networks bridge chain to upgrade themselves from single chain application to a multi-chain/cross-chain version.

<hr />

### How do I transfer the Ring from my wallet into my Darwinia account?

RING resides on various blockchain networks, currently it supports Ethereum and TRON.  Mainnet is coming soon.  If you mean transfer your ERC20 RING on Ethereum wallet to your Darwinia native wallet.  You will need to do a cross-chain transfer.  When mainnet is launched, the first decentralized bridge will be set up between Ethereum and Darwinia, you can do that at [https://wormhole.darwinia.network](https://wormhole.darwinia.network).

<hr />

### When I copy-paste your contract id into metamask to add as a custom token, it does not like it at all.

We have detected and received several reports regarding fake RING and KTON token contracts. 

Unfortunately the [address](https://etherscan.io/token/0x5d144af283c6aa7bab4abf99369032cbdc56ccc9) you mentioned is a fake address.


The real token address are shown below, they are also published at [Native Tokens](https://docs.darwinia.network/docs/en/wiki-us-tokens).

<hr />

### Are RING and KTON ERC-20 tokens on Uniswap legit? 

There are legitimate RING and KTON trading pairs on Uniswap but there are some fake tokens as well.  Please confirm and ensure the token addresses are correct according to the information below before swapping.

* [**RING**](https://uniswap.info/token/0x9469d013805bffb7d3debe5e7839237e535ec483)

* [**KTON**](https://uniswap.info/token/0x9f284e1337a815fe77d2ff4ae46544645b20c5ff)


RING is also available at Tron’s Justswap:

<hr />

### How many exchanges have listed RING or KTON?

There are around 8 centralized and decentralized exchanges that are trading RING or KTON at the time of writing.  The list keeps growing, please check out [this page](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/darwinia-network/markets/) for a real time answer.

<hr />

### Why does it show RING on Justswap? Is it a real one?

Yes, Darwinia Network is a cross-chain infrastructure project, it supports Ethereum and Tron at the moment, there are some RINGs transferred to Tron network, although the majority of supplies are on Ethereum at the moment. The Justswap RING trading pair is legit, but they're fake ones as well, please make sure you are trading with this RING ([detail](https://justswap.io/#/scan/detail/TFCBjh9pt2sTWmJJRpbqyxfi5xW81xH4UR/TL175uyihLqQD656aFx3uhHYe1tyGkmXaW)).

<hr />

### Where can I read about Darwinia’s tokenomics?

Please check out [here](https://docs.darwinia.network/docs/en/wiki-us-tokens). You can also move to the Economical model page on the Darwinia new Website.

<hr />

### What's the circulating supply of RING and KTON?

* [RING](https://api.darwinia.network/supply/ring)

* [KTON](https://api.darwinia.network/supply/kton)


<hr />

### What's the difference between ChainX and Darwinia?

We are both developing bridges, but ChainX's bridge operates under a federated custodial model where a group of nodes use multisig to manage the assets, mint, and redeem, and carries counterparty risk because it is semi-centralized. Sure is better than a fully centralized model, but there could still be collusion if assets' value is high enough.

Darwinia's bridge is based on super light client and assets are secured through Smart Contract. Foreign chain event awareness is done through light client (SPV model) and  asset minting and redemption are based on the light client, not one or several people saying so. 

Short Answer: Darwinia is trustless and decentralized, without similar counterparty risk compared to ChainX.

<hr />

### Is there a need to perform a token swap for RING or KTON once the mainnet is live? Will they expire as ERC20 tokens?

No, your ERC20 and TRC20 versions of Darwinia tokens will not expire but continue to coexist on different blockchains as long as Darwinia Network does and supports cross-chain transfer.

<hr />

### I waited two weeks for my tokens to unbond from staking but only a small portion were released and the rest are locked somehow. How do I get them back so I can stake again?

If you have bonded any tokens while participating in council election, those tokens will be locked and can be released by sending this extrinsic to cancel:

<hr />

### How do I stake or lock RING to receive KTON?

**As per the Stonky guide**:

* First go [here](https://darwinia.network/) and create a wallet on Darwinia. (Do not forget to switch to Darwinia mainnet. The crab is a testnet. Left upper corner of the wallet, click and switch it.)

* Then go [here](https://wormhole.darwinia.network/) and click on Ethereum, then click on Cross-chain Transfer.
  
  ![](assets/wiki-faq-guide-1-en.png)

* Another screen will pop up, again select Cross-chain Transfer on this page. At that point metamask will pop up, and you can now transfer. Now paste your Darwinia address, select tokens you are transferring, select submit. Make sure to have 10 RING in metamask as well as a little ETH to pay the transfer fees.
  
  ![](assets/wiki-faq-guide-2-en.png)

(Don't be alarmed by your tokens takes a long time to show up in wallet, the ethereum network is congested. Expect 35min)

**In mainnnet wallet**

you need to bond them (leave a tiny bit out for fees) and nominate a validator. once you do that in the next era (about 24h) your amount is properly staked, and after one more era (24h more) you start receiving daily rewards.

On the left there are 2 staking pages. the first one is what you stake. there you should find your amount, and by clicking bond you can select lock time.

Once you do that you go to the other staking page where all the nominators are. you can nominate multiple, but i just nominated one and worked fine, the difference is probably in commission but they're quite similar, (the one i use has 5% for instance. you can do this step after you stake.)

About the nominators i believe is all good, about the power that's flexible and may go slightly up or down depending on the share in the pool you join.

<hr />

### If the Ethereum to Darwinia Network bridge is only open one way for now, and KTON are only minted when users stake their RING and not transferable from Crab testnet, where did the existing supply of KTON in circulation come from?

The existing KTON in circulation were mined or generated within the game Evolution Land.
